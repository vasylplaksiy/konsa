    <h3>People-Driven Design & Technology</h3>
    <img class="lazyImg" data-src="upload/design-technology.jpg" alt="">
    <h4>We put people at the heart of Design and Technology.</h4>
    <p>At BenQ, we believe that design and technology function best when they serve the real needs and wants of people.
        This concept is at the core of our people-driven approach to design and technology. We listen to business
        professionals, families, doctors and patients, teachers, and even gamers, continually asking questions to
        understand how we can best use design and technology to serve their needs. We also carefully research and
        analyze the marketplace and market trends, observing how technologies and products can be put to use most
        effectively, while advancing design and technology to better fit people’s ever-changing lifestyles and needs.
        From here, we determine how we can further improve the quality of people’s lives and help them to achieve their
        goals. Because using design and technology to serve the real needs and wants of people matters.</p>
